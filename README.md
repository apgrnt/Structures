# Structures

This is just a repository for me to store some practice problems I'm doing from Cracking the Coding Interview.
It'll probably end up a hodgepodge of different homegrown data structures and test cases and test cases for differnet practice problems. I've set it up as a Maven project.

I'm mostly doing this as a refresher of data structures and interview prep while I'm backpacking Europe for a month. Something to do when I'm on trains and flying.
